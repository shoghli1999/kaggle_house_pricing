   - If it doesn't open automatically, navigate to the URL manually

## 📋 Usage Instructions

### **Step-by-Step Workflow:**

1. **Start with Overview**: Check that all data files are available
2. **Data Analysis**: Explore your data, check correlations, select features
3. **Model Training**: Run preprocessing, feature selection, and model training
4. **Results & Evaluation**: Analyze model performance and overfitting
5. **Predictions**: Generate and download final predictions

### **Important Notes:**

- **Follow the order**: Complete each step before moving to the next
- **Check warnings**: The app will guide you through the process
- **Session state**: Your progress is saved during the session
- **Data requirements**: Ensure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are present

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Dependencies:**
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Static plotting

- Consistent color schemes and themes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Import errors**: Ensure `housing_prices_improved.py` is in the same directory
2. **Data not found**: Check that `train.csv` and `test.csv` exist
3. **Memory issues**: Large datasets might require more RAM
4. **Plotting errors**: Some matplotlib plots might need backend configuration

### **Debug Tools:**
- Use the Settings tab to check session state
- Clear session state if you encounter issues
- Check console output for detailed error messages

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

## 🔒 Security Notes

- The dashboard runs locally on your machine
