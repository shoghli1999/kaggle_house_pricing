# 🏠 Improved Housing Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project was inspired by Kaggle’s well-known House Prices dataset, which offers a rich set of property features for building predictive models. I chose it as a learning exercise to explore advanced techniques for preventing overfitting in regression models, particularly with Random Forests. While the dataset and problem setup come from Kaggle, this work is not part of the competition — instead, it uses the scenario as a practical case study.

The original idea was to take a typical overfitted Random Forest baseline and transform it into a robust, generalizable prediction pipeline. Along the way, I experimented with aggressive feature selection, conservative hyperparameter tuning, advanced regularization techniques, and an ensemble approach combining Random Forest with Ridge Regression. The result is a streamlined, production-ready workflow that not only achieves strong predictive performance but also serves as a reference for overfitting prevention strategies in real-world machine learning projects.

## 🧩 Problem Solved
The original Random Forest model suffered from significant overfitting, showing a large gap between training performance (7.99% MAPE) and validation performance (12.14% MAPE). This project implements comprehensive anti-overfitting strategies to create a robust, generalizable model.

## 🚀 Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Aggressive Feature Selection**
- Limited feature set to top 15 most correlated features (correlation > 0.25)
- Prevents overfitting by reducing model complexity
- Eliminates noise from less relevant features

### 2. **Conservative Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Max Depth**: Limited to ≤ 6 (vs. unlimited in original)
- **Min Samples Split**: Increased to ≥ 10 (vs. default 2)
- **Min Samples Leaf**: Increased to ≥ 5 (vs. default 1)
- **Number of Trees**: Optimized to 100 (vs. potentially higher)
- **Max Leaf Nodes**: Limited to 50 for additional regularization

### 3. **Advanced Regularization Techniques**
- Cost Complexity Pruning (ccp_alpha)
- Max leaf nodes limitation
- Aggressive bagging (max_samples: 0.5-0.7)
- Feature sampling per split (max_features: sqrt, 0.2, 0.25)

### 4. **Ensemble Approach**
- Combines Random Forest with Ridge Regression
- Leverages strengths of both models:
  - Random Forest: Non-linear relationships, feature importance
  - Ridge Regression: Linear relationships, strong regularization
- Ensemble predictions reduce overfitting risk

### 5. **Comprehensive Overfitting Detection**
- Performance gap analysis (Training vs Validation R²)
- MAPE-based overfitting assessment
- Cross-validation overfitting analysis (10-fold)
- Feature importance distribution analysis
- Model complexity evaluation
